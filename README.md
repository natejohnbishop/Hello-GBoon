# Hello-GBoon
GBoon Repository

Our partner isn't always available to rub sunscreen into our back before we enjoy a day at the beach.  Grab a GBoonStuck and get the job done.  

GBoon is derived from the Japanese word, Jibun, "myself" or "oneself".  Our company is on a mission to help everyone at the beach lather up to protect themselves from the dangers of the sun.  

Order your stick today for your trip to paradise tomorrow.
